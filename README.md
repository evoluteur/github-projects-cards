# GitHub-Projects-Cards

This project is a simple web page to fetch and display GitHub projects as cards.

Check out the [live demo](https://evoluteur.github.io/github-projects-cards) and the [raw data](https://api.github.com/users/evoluteur/repos) from [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

The page displays your projects as cards with the total number of stars.

For each project the card shows the project name, stars, forks, descriptions, language, creation date, and last update, as well as links to the GitHub repo, demo, and [star history](https://star-history.com/) charts.

Just change the "user" value (at the top of the [/js/repo.js](https://github.com/evoluteur/github-projects-cards/blob/main/js/repos.js) file) to display your projects instead of mine...
